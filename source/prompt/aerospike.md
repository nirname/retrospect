# Aerospike

## Ubuntu Install Steps

**Step 1:**

First, on our Linux Ubuntu server we will download the Aerospike database software. Navigate to your preferred directory and run:

```bash
wget -O aerospike.tgz 'http://aerospike.com/download/server/latest/artifact/ubuntu12'
```

**Step 2:**

Next, we will un-tar the file. Run:

```bash
tar -xvf aerospike.tgz
```

**Step 3**:

Our next step will be to cd into the directory and run the install.

```
cd aerospike-server-community-*-ubuntu12
  sudo ./asinstall # will install the .rpm packages
```

**Step 4**:

Our last step is to start our Aerospike Database service.

```bash
sudo service aerospike start && sudo tail -f /var/log/aerospike/aerospike.log | grep cake
# wait for it. "service ready: soon there will be cake!"
```

** Note that root access (sudo) is required to install packages.

## Commands

**Start Aerospike Server**

For Aerospike Enterprise, start instructs the server to Fast Restart, if running Aerospike Community or running a namespace that isn't supported this command behaves the same as coldstart. For more information regarding restart modes, see Restart Modes.

To start aerospike database service:

```bash
/etc/init.d/aerospike start
```

**Coldstart Aerospike Server**

For Aerospike Enterprise, coldstart forces the server to rebuild the in-memory index by scanning the persisted records. This may take a significant amount of time depending on the size of the data. For Aerospike Community this is the same behavior as start.

```bash
/etc/init.d/aerospike coldstart
```

**Get Running Status of Aerospike Server**

To determine if the Aerospike Daemon is currently running, use the status command:

```bash
/etc/init.d/aerospike status
```

The status command doesn't inform you when the service port is ready, instead use the STATUS info command which will return "OK" when ready:

```bash
asinfo -v STATUS
```

**Restart Aerospike Server**

The restart command is equivalent to running stop followed by start:

```bash
/etc/init.d/aerospike restart
```

**Stop Aerospike Server**

To shutdown the Aerospike Server use the stop command:

```bash
/etc/init.d/aerospike stop
```
