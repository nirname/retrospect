<h1 id="hosts">Hosts</h1>
<p>Modifying your hosts file allows you to override the DNS for a domain, on that particular machine. This is useful when you want to test your site without the test link, prior to going live with SSL; verify that an alias site works, prior to DNS changes; and for other DNS-related reasons. Modifying your hosts file causes your local machine only to look directly at the IP address specified.</p>
<p>You need to add two entries to your hosts file that contain the IP address that you want the site to resolve to and the address. Adding the following two lines, for example, point www.domain.com and domain.com to our current PHP5-ITK (“Refreshed” PHP5) cluster:</p>
<pre><code>64.49.219.194 www.domain.com
64.49.219.194 domain.com</code></pre>
<p>The following sections provide instructions for locating and editing the hosts file on several operating systems. After you add the domain information and save the file, your system begins resolving to the specified IP address. After testing is finished, remove these entries.</p>
<pre><code>Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista
Windows NT, Windows 2000, and Windows XP
Linux
Mac OS X 10.0 through 10.1.5

You will see entries for -DHCP-, broadcasthost, and localhost in the third column.

A confirmation alert appears.
Click Duplicate.
A new entry called localhost copy appears, and its properties are shown below the browser view.

Double-click the value of the name property and enter the hostname you want for the other computer.
Click the serves property and select Delete from the Edit menu.

sudo nano /private/etc/hosts

Type your domain user password when prompted.
Edit the hosts file.
The file contains some comments (lines starting with the # symbol), and some default hostname mappings (for example, 127.0.0.1 – local host). Add your new mappings after the default mappings.
Save the hosts file by pressing Control+x and answering y.
Make your changes take effect by flushing the DNS cache with the following command:

dscacheutil -flushcache

The new mappings should now take effect.</code></pre>
